Most of jmp go on decrypt(srand())
We do not want to base our exploit on rand
So there is another condition for calling decrypt

0x1337d00d - input must be below 0x15 (21)
0x1337d00d -> 322424845

The result of this substraction will be powered by two and 0x80489f0 will be addedd
We then jump to this address and go on decrypt

There is a script in resources to get the pass, it will basically bruteforce the 21 possibility
After running the script we knows that giving 322424827 is the right input to access a new shell as level04
322424845 - 322424827 = 18 ( < 21)

sh get_pass.sh
~/level03
322424827

cd ../level04
cat .pass
