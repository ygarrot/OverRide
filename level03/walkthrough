Most of jmp go on decrypt(srand())
We do not want to base our exploit on rand
So there is another condition for calling decrypt

0x1337d00d - password (integer) must be below 0x15 (21)

The result of this substraction will be powered by two and 0x80489f0 will be addedd

We then jump to this address and go on decrypt

>>> 0x1337d00d
322424845

322424845 - 322424827 = 18 ( < 21)

There is a script in resources to get the pass
sh get_pass.sh
~/level03
322424827

cd ../level04
cat .pass
