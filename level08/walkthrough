mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09
~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass


We see in the source that the program create a copy of the file given in argument.
Since we do not have permissions on "/home/users/level08/backup" we have to go on /tmp
and then we create those directories: backups/home/users/level09, because the program concatenate 
the name given in parameter (/home/users/level09/.pass) with "./backups"

The result is that the file /home/users/level09/.pass will be copy at
/tmp/backups/home/users/level09/.pass
